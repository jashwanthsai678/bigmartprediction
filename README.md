# bigmartprediction
this is also a basic machine learning project which is written in python language
first we took a bigmart dataset and performed some operations on the dataset which is also known
as cleaning of the dataset
then we found the coorrelations between them and then used scikit learn libraries which we fit the dataset in the 
in these ML alogrithms then we used ensemble learning techinque and found the accuracy of the test dataset
